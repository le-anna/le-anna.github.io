            Hi! My name is Anna, and I'm a Computer Science student
            minoring in Mass Communications at the University of Florida.
            My expected graduation date is December 2022.
            <br/><br/>
            After participating in the Women in Computer Science & Engineering
            Shadowing Program, I developed a passion for developing frontend solutions. 
            <br/><br/>
            This has lead to my involvement in a few research labs, as I am interested in understanding how
            research can be used to learn more about the users and their needs. 
            As of current, I am working as a UX/UI designer and frontend developer for Choices, a project in the
            Sickle Cell Disease & Traits Lab.
            My work in CaSMM, a project in the Engaging Learning Lab, involves
            improving the existing interface for 5th and 6th grade students to learn how to code Arduinos.
            As these applications are designed for a specific target audience,
            much attention is given to developing optimal UX solutions. I am also a Coordinator in the Peggy Borum 
            Ketogenic Therapy Lab, in which I am creating website content and a style guide for the software.
            <br/><br/>

            <br/><br/>
