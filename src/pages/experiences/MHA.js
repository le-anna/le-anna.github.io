          <h2 className='animation slide'>Project Overview</h2>
          <p>The Mental Health App was developed through the <strong>Women in Computer Science & Engineering (WiCSE) Shadowing Programing</strong>. 
            As part of the program, students were paired with an industry professional to create a project. For my project, I recieved the opportunity of working with a mentor from <strong>Opie Software</strong>.</p>
          <br/>
          <p>The inspiration for the project was to develop a <strong>full-stack application</strong> that allows users to track the progression of their mental health. </p>
          <br/>
          <h3>Frontend technologies</h3>
          <p>JavaScript, React Native</p>
          <br/>
          <h3>Backend technologies</h3>
          <p><strong>Java, SQL, Hibernate, Spring Boot</strong></p>
          <br/>
          <h3>Timeline</h3>
          <p>August 2020 - December 2020</p>

          <h2 className='animation slide'>Process</h2>
          <p>
            The Mental Health project was an enlightening experience for me. This was my first full-stack project, so there was a lot to learn 
            in the initial stages.
            <br/>
            <br/>
           </p>
           <h3>Languages? Technologies?</h3>
           <p>
            To start, I used SQL for my database, as I wanted to work with a relational database.
            I chose Java for my backend langauge to develop a stronger understanding of it. 
            With Java and SQL decided upon, I added Hibernate and Spring Boot as the remaining technologies to my backend tech stack;
            Hibernate to map my Java objects to the SQL database, and Spring Boot for its REST services. 
            <br/><br/>
            For my frontend technologies, I used React Native (JavaScript), which provides tools to create mobile applications.

          <h2 className='animation slide'>Midpoint Status</h2>
          <h3>Initial design problems</h3>
          <p>This project posed a new challenge that I had not expected: design. I struggled with
            coming up with an idea for the look and feel of the project.
            My experience with UI design was little to none at this point. As a consequence, I chose a singular accent color, changed the border-radius, and kept it minimal. 
            I thought that it would be enough just to change those few properties, believing that it would pass off as minimal. 
            <br/><br/>
            I soon came to a realization: it was not.
          </p>
          <br/>
          <h3>Analysis of Initial Design</h3>
            <ul className='ul'>
              <li>App was not visually appealing due to singular color; pages felt flat and did not encourage engagement.</li>
              <li>There were several issues related to <strong>consistency</strong>: [1] the dropdown and input components have different stylings (border presence, border color, and background color vary); 
              [2] green elements use both black and white as a text color; [3] buttons change in size across different pages.</li>
              <li>Feedback highlighted an issue with the button affordance, as the x icon looks like an error rather than delete.</li>
            </ul>
            <br/>
            <h3>New Goal</h3>
            <p>After re-evaluating my current progress, I decided to allot more attention to improving the design of the app. 
            </p>
            <br/>
            <h3>How To Achieve Goal? Research?</h3>
            <p>To achieve this goal, I dedicated time to researching mobile apps and identifying various design approaches. For instance,
              I reviewed a plethora of UI designs for different applications and made note of any reoccuring themes that I liked. From this research, 
              I gained a <strong>key takeaway</strong>: design is important.

          <h2 className='animation slide'>Conclusion</h2>
          <p>Overall, I felt proud of what I created by the end. Learning how to create a full-stack application
            was daunting at first - I couldn't comprehend how everything was interconnected. I began the Mental Health project feeling intimidated by design to 
            uncovering a newfound passion for it. I am grateful for WiCSE's Shadowing Program for this opportunity.
