        <h2>Previous Design Problems ‚ùå</h2>
        <p>
          The previous application was developed around 2008, so some pages contained outdated
          styling.

        <h3>Analysis</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Color scheme is not cohesive; the green/yellow shade does not pair well with the other
            two colors.
          </li>
          <li>
            Navigation bar does not clearly depict an application that follows a sequential mode of
            learning; the names on the tabs also do not fit well.
          </li>
          <li>
            Buttons are 3D, which stand out prominently on the page; 3D styled buttons are not
            common and need to be updated. The buttons are not consistent, as seen with the "Submit"
            and "Next" buttons.
          </li>
          <li>
            The interface contains many unneeded elements in a page, which can feel distracting to
            users: the green/yellow outline below the login inputs, the black bar below the next
            buttons on the second screen, and the green/yellow border at the top. These extra
            elements can make a page feel busy, taking away from the actual content.
          </li>

        <h2>User Research</h2>
        <p>
          Research was conducted on developing an inclusive design for people with Sickle Cell
          Disease. People with Sickle Cell Disease are more likely to experience vision problems.
          Thus, focus was placed on the web application‚Äôs{' '}
          <strong>readability and accessibility</strong>. When developing prototypes, several font
          types, font sizes, and line spacings were examined to create the most optimal solution.
          During implementation, the <strong>reponsiveness </strong>
          of features with zooming in and out were tested to ensure content was{' '}
          <strong>readable</strong>.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div className='flex-justify column choices-container'>
        <h2>Solutions üí° + High-fidelity Mockups üé®</h2>
        <p>
          For my solution, I decided on a <strong>minimalistic design </strong>
          to <strong>centralize user focus on the tasks & content</strong>. This contrasts with the
          previous design, as it helps eliminate distractions for the user and makes the pages feel
          less busy. Moreover, the project had to be completed within a{' '}
          <strong>fast timeframe</strong>. Accordingly, a minimal design permits more time for
          debugging and further development of any additional features.
        </p>
        <h3>High-fidelity Mockups</h3>
        <p>
          I developed <strong>high-fidelity</strong> mockups with <strong>Figma</strong> for desktop
          and mobile views. Why high-fidelity? These mockups would more accurately represent the
          final solution and consequently allow for a better analysis of the application. Mockups
          underwent several iterations to consider the placement and appearance of all elements
          within a page. Review sessions were conducted several times a week to discuss the mockups.
          Approximately <strong>40 mockups</strong> were developed during this stage.
        </p>
        <p>
          [RE: Old Color Scheme] I proposed 3 options for color combinations that were similar to
          the old color scheme. The row with the star was agreed upon (yellow ended up being
          unneeded).

        <p>
          [RE: Navigation] To demonstrate the sequential nature of the learning, the navigation menu
          was redesigned. As shown in the image below, the new navigation menu models a learning
          module.

        <h2>Implementation üë©üèª‚Äçüíª</h2>
        <h3>Process</h3>
        <p>
          Data had to be pulled from the database, which meant that the designs had to work as a
          template. Along with different page layouts, I had to create styling for different types
          of data. A question, for instance, could have a number input, free response, or table with
          nested buttons. As another example, some content required media content while others did
          not.
        </p>
        <p>
          The overall implementation of the application did not take much time due to the
          high-fidelity prototypes. I spent more time on refining the layout and debugging issues
          after testing with real data. A page could contain different typography elements, lists,
          popups, nested content, media, etc. Ergo, all the data had to be defined by HTML DOM
          elements - in total, this meant about <strong>100 pages</strong> of content.
        </p>
        <p>
          In order to streamline the development process, I developed one main Sass (CSS
          Preprocessor) file to customize the HTML DOM elements used in the application.
          Standardizing the elements ensured <strong>consistency</strong> throughout the
          application.
        </p>
        <h3>Road Bumps Encountered</h3>
        <p>
          It was tricky finding the best positioning for the virutal human videos, as the purpose
          was to supplement the material but not distract. After feedback from the team, we decided
          that the text should wrap the virtual human video at the bottom.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another bump I experienced was writing the code with HTML. The backend portion of the
          project used specific technologies that did not integrate well with frontend services like
          React. As a result, I used HTML and Sass, which were not as ideal for creating components
          and passing data between pages/elements.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div className='flex-justify column choices-container'>
        <h2>Finish Line (Concluding Work) üèÅ</h2>
        <p>
          After the designs and implementation were completed, the rest of the work involved
          modifying the styling to adapt to real data from the database. Some other features (not in
          mockups) needed to be developed, as content was progressively approved for the study.
        </p>
        <h3>Some features I made:</h3>
        <p>
          Desktop and mobile screens, registration and Login page, navigation that shows users‚Äô
          progress, card layout for questions, and video popups with mask overlay.

        <h2>Learning Outcomes & Successes ‚úÖ</h2>
        <h3>Coding Conventions & Templates</h3>
        <p>
          From the project, I learned better coding conventions and how to write stylistic code
          efficiently. I had not worked with an application that used such a large amount of
          information before, so I was initially unsure of how to turn the designs into templates.
          Because pure HTML/CSS was being used, it was not possible to create custom components.
          However, I still wanted to be as organized as possible. Thus, I decided to create a main
          stylesheet that standardized the styling of the HTML DOM elements.
        </p>
        <h3>UX Design Process</h3>
        <p>
          The process of working on this project taught me a lot about UX Design. There were many
          conversations about things such as the most optimal placement or design of an element. The
          design process placed emphasis on ensuring accessible content, and the team referenced
          research papers about web application design.
        </p>
        <h3>Mockups -> Code</h3>
        <p>
          I was really excited to see how well I was able to translate my mockups into actual code!
          Developing high-fidelity mockups made the process of writing the code much faster.
