          <p className='animation slide'>Research on various educational platforms for children highlight a common theme: the use of vibrant colors.  Brighter colors are more engaging, especially to the specific target audience; in this case, 5th 
          and 6th grade students.
          <br/> <br/> 
          I paid particular attention to several <strong> UX Design Principles: Consistency, Affordance, and Discoverability.</strong>
          <br/> <br/> 
          In the design solution, I proposed implementing an accent color in the new style guide. 
          An accent color used specifically to denote clickable items would improve the discoverability of the element. As well, the change in button style would
          make it more consistent to buttons found in other applications. During development, much discussion revolved around ensuring the affordance of elements, so students could easily identify them.
          The rest of my work involved improving the UI to fit the style guide.

              <h3>before</h3>
              <p>
                This was the Mentor view before any changes were made to the design. The afforance
                for the buttons is poor. The grey color and rectangular shape of the button is not consistent with other designs for buttons found in other applications, which makes the functionality ambiguous. The text within the box is also small and not readable.

              <h3>after</h3>
              <p>
                The card was redesigned to improve readability. The content was divided up into sections, allowing Mentors to quickly find the information they need. The accessibility was also improved, as Mentors can now click on the Join Code (a popup to display the code in classrooms for students) 
                instead of having to click on the View button to access it on another page.

              <p>The Roster view contains a grid of cards with information for each student. As observed from the image,
              the Roster view shares a similar issue with the Mentor view in regard to the buttons: poor affordance. The cards are also not responsive, 
              causing the features to overlap which makes the text indecipherable.

              <p>The redesign improved the responsiveness of the page. Further, the cards model the layout of a profile page
              with the yellow color to represent the header. The size of the icon was also increased, so Mentors can identify the image better.
