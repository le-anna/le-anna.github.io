            <strong>Concept: </strong>A mobile app called Film Club that people can use to converse
            about shows & movies.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Motivation & Process: </strong>Often, I see people talking about movies & shows
            across all media appsâ€”from Twitter to Reddit. I, myself, have also lurked on these apps,
            hoping to find community over the grievances or drama of a new episode. Thus, I was
            motivated to design an app that would simplify this, centralizing all communication to
            one place. Because ideal users are people who watch movies & shows, I thought a dark UI
            would suit best. People tend to be in dark or dim lighting; thus, a bright UI design
            would be jarring on the eyes.

            <strong>Concept: </strong>A mobile app called PawMates that people can use to adopt a
            pet.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Motivation: </strong>
            Adopting a pet probably the most thrilling feeling ever! I felt that creating an
            engaging and vibrant UI was necessary to couple with the feeling of adding a new family
            member; thus, I placed focus on choosing the right colors during this, as colors can
            influence how people feel.
